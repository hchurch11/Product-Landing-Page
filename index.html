                    <h2>Tailored instruction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lessons have a basic structure of what needs to be
                        learned as a young percussionist, but lessons are also
                        tailored to the specific goals of the students. I work
                        with students on preparing for solo and ensemble
                        contest, drum corps and all-state auditions, repertoire
                        they are learning in band, and anything else that the
                        student might want to focus on!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To me, it's important that the student has a say in their music education. If you are just
                        drilling the basics and not targetting what also interests the student, the student is likely to
                        not stick with his/her new instrument for long.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Lesson Structure</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lessons start with sight reading which is a very
                        important skill that should be learned in the beginning
                        of learning any instrument. After sight-reading, I'll usually go over what was assigned after
                        the last lesson. If the skill I assigned has been completed, then I will introduce a new concept
                        that will be worked on partially at the lesson. Then the student will have to dive deeper into
                        that skill/content as homework and present it at their next lesson.
                    </p>

                <div class="col-4">
                    <h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
                    <p>
                        If the student commits to the practice and practice time assigned, I guarenteed that the student
                        will improve, no matter the skill or talent level.
                    </p>
                    <p> Practice is a key part of taking lessons. Students will learn new skills and concepts each week
                        in their lessons, so it is crucial to their growth that they do their homework (practicing)
                        every week. </p>
